# CI Workflow Update Summary

The GitHub Actions CI workflow has been updated to include testing, linting, and building for the client application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Job Renaming and Separation

The original monolithic jobs have been split into separate backend and client jobs:

#### Before:
- `test` (backend only)
- `lint` (backend only)
- `build` (backend only)
- `security` (backend only)

#### After:
- `test-backend` - Backend tests with PostgreSQL and Redis
- `test-client` - **NEW** - Client unit tests
- `lint-backend` - Backend linting and type checking
- `lint-client` - **NEW** - Client linting and type checking
- `build-backend` - Backend TypeScript build
- `build-client` - **NEW** - Client Vite build
- `security` - Backend security audit (unchanged)

### 2. New Client Test Job

```yaml
test-client:
  name: Test Client on Node ${{ matrix.node-version }}
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  
  strategy:
    matrix:
      node-version: [18.x, 20.x]
```

**Steps:**
1. Checkout code
2. Setup Node.js with npm cache for `client/package-lock.json`
3. Install client dependencies (`npm ci` in `./client`)
4. Run client unit tests (`npm test`)
5. Run client tests with coverage (`npm run test:coverage`)
6. Upload coverage to Codecov with `client` flag (Node 20.x only)

**What it tests:**
- All 50 unit tests for auth components and services
- Form validation logic
- AuthService methods with mocked API
- Token refresh logic
- ProtectedRoute redirect behavior

### 3. New Client Lint Job

```yaml
lint-client:
  name: Lint and Format Check (Client)
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

**Steps:**
1. Checkout code
2. Setup Node.js with npm cache for `client/package-lock.json`
3. Install client dependencies
4. Check TypeScript types (`npm run type-check`)
5. Run ESLint (`npm run lint`)

### 4. New Client Build Job

```yaml
build-client:
  name: Build Client
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

**Steps:**
1. Checkout code
2. Setup Node.js with npm cache for `client/package-lock.json`
3. Install client dependencies
4. Build client (`npm run build`) - Creates production Vite bundle

### 5. Codecov Integration Updates

The Codecov upload steps now use separate flags to distinguish coverage:

- **Backend coverage**: `flags: backend`, `name: codecov-backend`
- **Client coverage**: `flags: client`, `name: codecov-client`

This allows separate tracking of backend and client test coverage in Codecov.

## CI Workflow Structure

The updated workflow now runs **8 jobs in parallel** (where applicable):

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Push/PR       │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
    ┌────┴────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                         │
    ├─ test-backend (Node 18.x, 20.x)       │
    ├─ test-client (Node 18.x, 20.x)        │
    ├─ lint-backend                          │
    ├─ lint-client                           │
    ├─ build-backend                         │
    ├─ build-client                          │
    └─ security                              │
```

## Test Matrix

Both test jobs run against:
- Node.js 18.x
- Node.js 20.x

Only Node.js 20.x uploads coverage reports to Codecov.

## Working Directory Strategy

Client jobs use `working-directory: ./client` for all npm commands, ensuring:
- Correct package.json is used
- Correct node_modules are accessed
- npm cache works with `client/package-lock.json`

## Benefits

1. **Parallel Execution**: Client and backend tests run simultaneously, reducing total CI time
2. **Independent Failures**: Client test failures don't affect backend test status and vice versa
3. **Separate Coverage**: Backend and client coverage are tracked independently
4. **Clear Naming**: Job names clearly indicate what's being tested
5. **Flexible**: Easy to add more client-specific jobs in the future

## Required Secrets

No new secrets are required. The existing `CODECOV_TOKEN` is used for both backend and client coverage uploads.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add E2E tests job for integration testing
- Add Storybook build verification
- Add visual regression testing
- Add bundle size checking
- Add performance benchmarks
- Add client security audit (similar to backend)

## Verification

To verify the CI workflow works correctly:

```bash
# Locally test what CI will run for client
cd client
npm ci
npm test
npm run test:coverage
npm run type-check
npm run lint
npm run build
```

All commands should complete successfully before pushing.
