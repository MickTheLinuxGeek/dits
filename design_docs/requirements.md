# Application Requirements: Solo Developer Issue Tracker

## 1.0 Functional Requirements

### 1.1 Core Issue Management (Must-Have)

* **1.1.1 Issue Creation:** Users must be able to create an issue with a title, description, status, priority, and labels.

* **1.1.2 Issue Attributes:**
    * **Title:** Plain text, mandatory. A concise, one-line summary of the task.
    * **Description:** Rich text field supporting full Markdown, including code blocks with syntax highlighting, checklists (`- [ ]`), and inline images. Must feature first-class GitHub Flavored Markdown support with comprehensive programming language syntax highlighting using mature libraries like Prism.js or highlight.js. Support for drag-and-drop image embedding and file attachments.
    * **Status:** Customizable states (e.g., `Backlog`, `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Done`, `Canceled`). Fully user-configurable with visual workflow editor for defining valid transitions between statuses.
    * **Priority:** Pre-defined, sortable levels (`No Priority`, `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Urgent`). Simple four-level system to avoid analysis paralysis while providing sufficient granularity.
    * **Labels/Tags:** Ability to create and assign multiple, color-coded labels for flexible categorization. Support for on-the-fly label creation with unique colors for quick visual identification.
    * **Dates:** Two distinct date fields:
        - **Start Date:** When the task becomes relevant or should enter active consideration
        - **Due Date:** Hard deadline for task completion
    * **Relationships:** Explicit links between issues to model dependencies (`related to`, `blocked by`, `blocking`).

* **1.1.3 Issue Modification:** Users must be able to seamlessly edit all attributes of an issue. Issues are treated as living, mutable documents rather than static records, supporting the individual developer's evolving understanding of problems.

* **1.1.4 Sub-tasks:** Users must be able to break down a parent issue into a checklist or a list of trackable sub-tasks, each with its own completion status. Sub-tasks are lightweight issues with their own title and status, allowing decomposition of large features without cluttering the main project view.

### 1.2 Organizational Structure

* **1.2.1 Projects (Must-Have):** Users must be able to group issues into distinct projects. Each project serves as a container with its own set of issues, views, and configurations. Projects represent finite bodies of work with clear, achievable goals and defined endpoints (e.g., "Implement New Auth System", "Launch v2.0 Website").

* **1.2.2 Areas (Must-Have):** Support for ongoing spheres of responsibility with no specific end date (e.g., "Work", "Personal", "Learning", "Home Maintenance"). This dual-hierarchy model prevents the anti-pattern of creating never-ending "projects" for maintenance tasks.

* **1.2.3 Milestones/Cycles (Should-Have):** Users should have the ability to group issues into time-boxed sprints or milestones to track progress toward larger objectives.

### 1.3 User Interface & Workflow

* **1.3.1 Multiple Views (Must-Have):**
    * **List View:** A dense, customizable table of issues that allows for sorting and displaying key properties as columns. Optimized for speed and efficiency with quick scanning, sorting, and inline editing capabilities.
    * **Board View (Kanban):** A visual board where issues are represented as cards that can be dragged and dropped between columns representing issue status. Ideal for visualizing flow and identifying bottlenecks.
    * **Calendar View:** Monthly or weekly calendar grid displaying issues based on Due Date, providing clear time-based perspective on deadlines and workload distribution.

* **1.3.2 Customizable Workflows (Should-Have):** Users should be able to define custom statuses and valid transition paths between them on a per-project basis. Visual, drag-and-drop workflow editor for intuitive configuration.

* **1.3.3 Smart Views (Must-Have):**
    * **Inbox:** Default destination for newly captured issues, serving as central triage hub
    * **Today:** Curated list of tasks for current day with calendar integration
    * **Upcoming:** Chronological view of issues with scheduled Start/Due dates
    * **Logbook:** Searchable archive of completed issues and projects

### 1.4 Productivity & Efficiency

* **1.4.1 Keyboard-First Navigation (Must-Have):** Every primary action in the application—including creating issues, changing status, navigating views, and searching—must be achievable via intuitive keyboard shortcuts. Comprehensive shortcut system including:
    - Navigation: `j`/`k` for list movement
    - Actions: `e` to edit, `c` to create, `l` for labels, `p` for priority, `d` for due date
    - View switching and customizable shortcuts to avoid conflicts

* **1.4.2 Command Palette (Must-Have):** A global command palette (accessed via `Cmd/Ctrl+K`) must provide fast, fuzzy-search access to all actions, settings, and navigation destinations. This serves as the central hub and primary interface for power users, exposing all functionality available in the graphical UI.

* **1.4.3 Powerful Search & Filtering (Must-Have):** The system must feature fast, full-text search across all issue attributes. Support for:
    - Quick filter bar with simple syntax (`label:bug priority:high is:open`)
    - Advanced query language for complex searches with logical operators
    - Saved filters appearing in navigation sidebar for one-click access to custom views

* **1.4.4 Frictionless Capture (Must-Have):** Multiple entry points for issue creation:
    - In-app creation with global keyboard shortcut
    - System-wide quick-entry popup (e.g., `Ctrl+Opt+Space`) appearing over any application
    - Command palette creation
    - API-based creation for custom scripts
    - Screenshot paste support for visual bug reporting

### 1.5 Integrations

* **1.5.1 Git Integration (Must-Have):**
    * Deep, bidirectional integration with **GitHub**, **GitLab**, and **Bitbucket**
    * Automated branch creation from issues with descriptive naming (e.g., `feature/123-new-auth-system`)
    * Automatic linking of pull/merge requests using keywords (`Fixes #123`, `Closes #123`)
    * Automatic issue closure when linked PR/MR is merged to main branch
    * Rich context display showing feed of related VCS events, branches, commits, and PR/MR status

* **1.5.2 Code Editor Integration (Should-Have):** 
    * First-party Visual Studio Code extension (launch requirement)
    * JetBrains IDE support (fast follow)
    * Features: view/manage issues in sidebar, contextual issue info for active branch, quick actions, frictionless issue creation from code

* **1.5.3 Public API and Webhooks (Must-Have):**
    * REST/GraphQL API exposing full CRUD operations for all core objects
    * Webhook support for real-time event notifications (`issue.created`, `issue.updated`, `issue.status.changed`)
    * Well-documented API enabling custom scripts and third-party integrations

* **1.5.4 Calendar Integration (Nice-to-Have):** Optional one-way synchronization of issues with due dates to external calendar applications like Google Calendar or Apple Calendar.

## 2.0 Non-Functional Requirements

    - CSV for spreadsheet analysis  
    - Plain text/Markdown for human-readable documentation
    - Customizable export templates for advanced use cases (Pro tier)

* **2.2.2 Import (Should-Have):** Straightforward import tool for migrating data from other systems, such as Trello, Jira, and GitHub Issues.

### 2.3 Platform Availability (Must-Have)
* **Desktop:** Native applications for **macOS**, **Windows**, and **Linux**. True native applications (not Electron wrappers) for maximum performance, lower resource consumption, and deep OS integration.
* **Web:** Full-featured web application for universal browser access, mirroring desktop functionality.
* **Mobile:** Fully native iOS and Android applications optimized for "away from keyboard" workflows:
    - Quick issue capture (including from screenshots)
    - Inbox management and task triage
    - Important notifications
    - "Today" list review
