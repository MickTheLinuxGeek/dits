## üéØ Overview

DITS eliminates the "collaboration tax" imposed by team-oriented tools while providing deep integration with developer ecosystems. Built for developers who need a powerful, fast, and distraction-free issue tracking system that actually understands their workflow.

**Why DITS?** Most issue trackers are built for teams and adapted for individuals. DITS is purpose-built from the ground up for the solo developer experience, removing complexity while adding the deep integrations that matter to your daily workflow.

### Core Principles

- **‚ö° Frictionless Capture** - Zero-friction issue creation from anywhere in your workflow
- **üéØ Optimized for Flow State** - Sub-100ms interactions, keyboard-first design, minimal context switching
- **üîó Context is King** - Deep bidirectional Git integration with automatic branch management
- **üíæ User Owns Their Data** - Complete data portability, local-first architecture, full export capabilities

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Issue Management
- Rich Markdown descriptions with syntax highlighting and code blocks
- Flexible organization with Projects (finite work) and Areas (ongoing responsibilities)
- Parent-child relationships and task dependencies with visual relationship graphs
- Custom workflows with per-project status transitions
- Priority levels, labels, start/due dates
- Full-text search with advanced filters

### Smart Views
- **Inbox** - Default destination for newly captured issues
- **Today** - Curated list for your current day
- **Upcoming** - Chronological view with scheduled dates
- **Logbook** - Archive of completed issues
- **Custom Views** - Create and save personalized issue filters

### Git Integration
- Automatic branch creation with semantic naming
- Branch naming based on issue priority and labels (hotfix/bugfix/feature)
- PR/MR tracking and automatic linking
- Webhook-driven status updates and synchronization
- Automatic issue closure on merge
- Commit linking with bi-directional references

### Developer Experience
- Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl+K) for power users
- Keyboard shortcuts for every action
- Offline-first architecture with seamless sync
- Multiple platforms: Web, Desktop (macOS/Windows/Linux), Mobile, IDE extensions
- Distraction-free UI designed for maximum focus

```

### Git Hooks

The project uses Husky with lint-staged for pre-commit hooks. On commit:
- ESLint runs with auto-fix on staged TypeScript files
- Prettier formats staged TypeScript files
- TypeScript type checking validates changes

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Technology Stack

#### Backend Services
- **Auth Service** - JWT authentication with OAuth2 for Git providers
- **Issue Service** - Core CRUD operations and search
- **Project Service** - Project and area organization
- **Sync Service** - Real-time updates via WebSocket
- **Integration Service** - Git provider integrations (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)

#### Data Layer
- PostgreSQL - Primary relational database
- Redis - Caching and session management
- Elasticsearch - Full-text search

#### Frontend Applications
- **Web App** - React 18+ with TypeScript, Vite build system
- **Desktop Apps** - Native per platform (Swift/SwiftUI for macOS, .NET MAUI for Windows, Electron for Linux)
- **Mobile Apps** - React Native for iOS and Android
- **IDE Extensions** - VS Code and JetBrains plugins

### Core Data Models

- **User** - Single-tenant model (no team entity)
- **Project** - Finite bodies of work with clear endpoints
- **Area** - Ongoing spheres of responsibility (Work, Personal, Learning)
- **Issue** - Core task/bug entity with rich metadata (title, description, priority, status, dates, labels)
- **Status/Workflow** - Customizable per-project status transitions
- **Label** - Color-coded flexible categorization
- **GitIntegration** - Links issues to branches, PRs, commits

Issues support:
- Parent-child relationships (sub-tasks)

- Full Markdown descriptions with syntax highlighting
- Start dates and due dates
- Multiple labels

### API Architecture

## üí° Philosophy

DITS is built on the belief that individual developers deserve tools designed specifically for their workflow, not adapted from team collaboration tools. Every design decision prioritizes:

1. **Speed** - Sub-100ms interactions maintain flow state and minimize context switching
2. **Simplicity** - No artificial complexity from team features or unnecessary collaboration overhead
3. **Integration** - Deep connections to developer tools and workflows you actually use
4. **Ownership** - Complete control over your data and workflow with no vendor lock-in

## üîí Security & Privacy

DITS takes your data privacy seriously:
- All data stored locally by default with optional remote sync
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- No telemetry or tracking without explicit opt-in
- OAuth2 with proper scopes for third-party integrations

**Status:** Early Development (Phase 1)
